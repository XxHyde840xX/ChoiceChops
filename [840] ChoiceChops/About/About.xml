    <name>XxHyde840xX's Choice Chops</name>
    <author>XxHyde840xX/Various</author>
    <description>A selection of choice items, carefully chopped from their respective mods. An exhaustive list is as follows;
	
	- [E.N.I.A.C]
			- Research pre-requisites changed to Electricity and Basic Microelectronics.
			- "CompProperties_HeatPusher" tweaked. Values half of original.
			- Spn out from the "Fortifications - Industrial" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2561619583.
			
	- [Golden Desert Eagle]
			- Completed original authors intent to provide mood buff/debuffs while equipped using Bill Door's "BDsGoldenGuns.dll" assembly.
			- Pawns equipped with one gain a +5 mood buff. Greedy pawns get +15 and ascetic pawns will get a -30 debuff instead.
			- Stats slightly tweaked, patched to spawn on Pirate Bosses, and Muzzle Flash compatiblity [WIP] attempted.
			- Spun out from the "Absolute Legends Guns" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2162631828.
			
	- [Gokusotsu Floor Drawings]
			- Kids are drawing dookies now, you boomers wouldn't understand.
			- Also a rainbow easter-egg! You'll know it when you see it.
			- Spun out from the "Gokusotsu Hell Guard" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2892925626.
	
	- [Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV]
			- Super-cool Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV. That's it.
			- I really liked it, but didn't need/want the Vault-111 suit it was packaged with.
			- Spun out from the "Fallout: Vault 111 Starter Pack" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985719270.
			
	- [Artemis Pistol - PREY]
			- Honestly, I spun this out just because I could and it was in my inactive mods list. Sounds like it's silenced.
			- Since it's gold, it also has the same weapon tag the Golden Desert Eagle does, enabling mood buffs.
			- Uncraftable. Pricey. Exotic. Biocodable. Obnoxious rate-of-fire and aiming cooldown. Did I mention it's gold?
			- Spun out from the "Artemis Golden Pistol from Prey 2017" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787812629.
			
	- [The Bravado - Formerly the "Dodge Challanger"]
			- This is another one I did, just because I could. The original mod was commissioned by Bino#2699.
			- Unfortunately, I felt the author did the bare minimum, and couldn't even be bothered to write a description.
			- Vehicle has been renamed, and defs have been corrected as to not OVERWRITE THE TRAVELLER FROM VANILLA VEHICLES EXPANDED.
			- I've also added a proper description, including driver/crew info, as well as fuel-type.
			- If you ever see this Bino#2699, hit me up and I'll give you my copy of this mod.
			- The original mod can be found at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3024596985.
			
	- [Psiamin]
			- Got bored, noticed the description was vauge, and included it to purge from my inactive mods.
			- 1 neutroamine, 2 psychoid leaves, 360 work cost to make. Psyfocus offset is at 0.15 and may need adjustment.
			- The original mod can be found at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2585560901.
			
	- [Badge Master]
			- I repackaged my Badge Master mod up for use. Unfortunately this adds another dependency. Deal with it.
			- Go on STEAM and search for "badge," you'll find the source material.
			- All credit goes to the original authors, I just yanked the textures and defs.
			- REQUIRES PAWN BADGE FAN FORK! Also now incompatible with 14 mods I can't be arsed to list!
			
	- [Responders Mod]
		- I love the Fallout series, and thought the armor was awesome. Unfortunately, for 3 pieces of gear it was a massive file.
		- Textures have been downscaled from 2134x2134 to a more reasonable 1067x1067.
		- I will downscale the textures to 512x512 if the file size is still large.
		- Completely incompatible with the original mod, found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2935563029,
		
	- [XSTAT]
		- Yeeted another mod out of my list thanks to this inclusion. Incompatible with the original mod.
		- Textures were 7112x7112 initially and have been downscaled to a respectable 256x256.
		- What is XSTAT? A small hemostatic device for the treatment of gunshot and shrapnel wounds.
		- The original mod can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2731817249.
	
	 - [Anima Obelisk - Standalone Retextured]
		- Safekeep some juice for when you really need it with a gorgeous new Anima Obelisk!
		- The Anima Obelisk allows any psycaster to meditate upon it, slowly accumulating psyfocus that can later be withdrawn by any other psycaster.
		- Retextured with MrKociak's fine work and made standalone by yours truly. Incompatibe with 
		- Original mods located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2614248835 / https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2825920536.
