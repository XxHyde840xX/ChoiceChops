    <description>A selection of choice items, carefully chopped from their respective mods. An exhaustive list is as follows;
	
	- [E.N.I.A.C]
			- Research pre-requisites changed to Electricity and Basic Microelectronics.
			- "CompProperties_HeatPusher" tweaked. Values half of original.
			- Spn out from the "Fortifications - Industrial" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2561619583.
			
	- [Golden Desert Eagle]
			- Completed original authors intent to provide mood buff/debuffs while equipped using Bill Door's "BDsGoldenGuns.dll" assembly.
			- Pawns equipped with one gain a +5 mood buff. Greedy pawns get +15 and ascetic pawns will get a -30 debuff instead.
			- Stats slightly tweaked, patched to spawn on Pirate Bosses, and Muzzle Flash compatiblity [WIP] attempted.
			- Spun out from the "Absolute Legends Guns" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2162631828.
			
	- [Gokusotsu Floor Drawings]
			- Kids are drawing dookies now, you boomers wouldn't understand.
			- Also a rainbow easter-egg! You'll know it when you see it.
			- Spun out from the "Gokusotsu Hell Guard" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2892925626.
	
	- [Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV]
			- Super-cool Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV. That's it.
			- I really liked it but didn't need/want the Vault-111 suit it was packaged with.
			- Spun out from the "Fallout: Vault 111 Starter Pack" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985719270.
			
	- [Artemis Pistol - PREY]
			- Honestly, I spun this out just because I could and it was in my inactive mods list. Sounds silenced and has a silly rate of fire.
			- Since it's gold, it also has the same weapon tag the Golden Desert Eagle does, enabling mood buffs.
			- Uncraftable. Pricey. Exotic. Biocodable. Did I mention gold?
			- Spun out from the "Artemis Golden Pistol from Prey 2017" mod, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787812629.
			
	- [NEXT UP: Rimmunation Clothing Replucked!]
